This project was created by 964712. This is simple script to support working with Facebook.com. Polish instruction is inside program. In file linki_wydarzen.txt there are only examples links. In file raport.txt there is examle report about one event. Program is still created so it may contain bugs. 

If you want to use it you have to clone or download this repository.

You have to install Python no less than 3.7.
At this time program works only on Mozilla Firefox.

After installing Python, you have to install Selenium modules. Run cmd and enter: 'python' and press Enter. You should see version of your Python. For example: Python 3.7.3. Remember, it can't be less than 3.7... After that press Ctrl+z and Enter on you keyboard to exit from Python or write in console: 'exit()'.

You also should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.

Finally you have to install Selenium module. So enter in console window: 'pip install selenium'

After that close console.

In directory config in file credentials.txt you have to in first line enter your login to acount fb in second line password. Save changes.

In file linki_wydarzen.txt paste links for events and run program. Select option and follow the instructions of the program. Finally in file raport.txt will be the report for your tasks. 
REMEMBER: Each time check the report because program has bugs. If report is ok, publish it.

If you have problem contact the creator.
